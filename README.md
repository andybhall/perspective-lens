# Perspective Lens

See political ideas through explicit ideological frames.

## Why This Tool Exists

AI systems often personalize responses based on what they infer about your views—without telling you. This creates an illusion of objectivity while quietly filtering information through hidden assumptions.

**Perspective Lens takes a different approach.** Instead of pretending to be neutral, it explicitly shows you how different ideological frameworks would analyze the same question. The bias becomes a tool you pick up, not a filter you can't see.

*Transparency preserves agency.*

## Available Perspectives
